                        Today Satisfactory 1.0 released, actually a lot sooner than what I thought it was going to (as I originally thought it was releasing at 8pm GMT). I stuck with my original plan and waited a few hours (as I had other things to do anyway) to play with 4 friends in a new world together. When we first booted up the game oh my, was the menu so beautiful. I was so excited to play Version 1.0 just look at that screen, it's just something to fall in love with.
                        <br> <br>
                        <img class="article-img width-75 center" src="\assets/images/article/2024/09/11/satisfactory-1.0-main-menu.png">
                        <br> <br>
                        Our game session was decided to be done mostly through Discord with 1 person actually using my PC at my house as they are over for the next few days and the one to host the server decided to invite us through a Session ID, We thought this would be fine with me being the first to try and load into the world.... 'Yay you are in Sam'... shortly lived as my whole laptop decided to crash. As I reset my stuff so I could hear my friends and hopefully play the game an error came up with the friend I had in my room, "It's ok, release often have this, just wait a minute and try again"... Little did we know this error would haunt at least one of us at a time through the evening if you where disconnected from the world.
                        <br> <br>
                        <img class="article-img width-75 center" src="\assets/images/article/2024/09/11/satisfactory-1.0-multiplayer-error.png">
                        <br> <br>
                        When we did actually get in a few of the people we where playing with fucked around well the others actually tried to make progress and it was amazing. Not only because I had never seen how good the graphics for Satisfactory had gotten because I normally play on Low settings on my PC. If you have a good PC it's really suggested to just boot the game with how beautiful the area can be, just look at where we started (The Northern Forest).
                        <br> <br>
                        <img class="article-img width-75 center" src="\assets/images/article/2024/09/11/satisfactory-1.0-northern-forest.png">
                        <br> <br>
                        One thing I noticed as soon as I got in the game is that the HUBs milestone menus have changed and looks so nice. It just makes me want to make progress, with easy to read tiers of progress along with what phase of space elevator you need to be on to start that tier, It's amazing to see how a simple and helpful a menu can be with some basic changes to it and truly shows that making something simple can make it pretty at the same time.
                        <br> <br>
                        <img class="article-img width-75 center" src="\assets/images/article/2024/09/11/satisfactory-1.0-hub-menu.png">
                        <br> <br>
                        The assistant is really nice with it now having a little 'ADA' logo above the text when it's talking about things, and even have humour involved making us laugh as we made progress together.
                        <br> <br>
                        <img class="article-img width-75 center" src="\assets/images/article/2024/09/11/satisfactory-1.0-ada.png">
                        <br> <br>
                        One of the best things I enjoy on 1.0 is the ability for customization, as you can now pick what colour you are along with even change your helmet, these options are slightly limited but are a welcome change from the early access, along with the colours being 100% customisable allowing you to post a HEX code into it. The Colour changes doesn't only change what you look like though but changes all your personal equipment too including portal miners.
                        <br> <br>
                        <img class="article-img width-75 center" src="\assets/images/article/2024/09/11/satisfactory-1.0-portable-mine.png">
                        <br> <br>
                        So overall I think this is a welcome change and there's got to be so many more things I am forgetting to write about along with haven't experienced in Satisfactory 1.0 including the new upgrades and fixed for conveyer belts. So if you have £30 of disposable income and are wanting a new game to play satisfactory might be a really cool experience to try rather alone or with friends.
