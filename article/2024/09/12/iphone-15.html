                        I've been an avid user of iPhone since the end of January this year, where I purchased my first iPhone, the iPhone SE Gen 2 (2020). When I got the phone it was for the pure reason to try out Apple, as upto that point I hadn't gave Apple an actual go other than a few times in the early days of iPads when selecting music on my Dads iPad every so often when I was over at his. Once getting my SE, I realised the screen was way to small, so I decided to purchase an iPad 9th Gen (2021), what allowed me to do so much more before purchasing a few more Apple Products such as an Apple TV 4k & an Apple Pencil.
                        <br> <br>
                        Yesterday I needed to go upgrade my phone, I kind of wanted to make my payments cheaper to save money towards something I actually know I want such as a Motorbike but if I got anything close to the price I wanted I couldn't go for Apple and as someone who used Android for about 10 years, I really didn't want to go back. Luckily my phone providor was able to give me a Apple Watch SE (not sure what version) apart of the price.
                        <br> <br>
                        What made me want to go for a 15? -- I had a few reasons I hated my SE but to best honest most of the problems had been solved in newer models or slightly more expencive iPhones, firstly the screen size; I really despised using my phone when it come to long winded tasks, what was a good thing when it came to using other devices but was annoying if I needed to work on something on the go and only had my phone. Secondly the Battery life, as I purchased an already used phone I quickly found that it seemed to not hold a charge all day especially if I was to use it to message or call someone (even for short periods of time) to the point that walking only a 10 minute walk dropped my battery percent by 5% before, obviously this is one of the worst cases.
                        <br> <br>
                        Thirdly, I was always fustrated that I had to rather carry around a Lightning Cable and a USB C or just the Lightning as my phone always needed charging as with the iPhone 15 upwards you now have USB C making only my iPad need to use the Lightning.
                        <br> <br>
                        Why not go for more premium iPhone 15? -- Simply money, I ended up just getting a iPhone 15 (128gb) as that was the cheapest iPhone I could get, well unless I wanted to still use Lightning but be paying like £2 less per month. Also there was not many other places for me to actually pay for my phone due to my low income and not many companies wanting to take the 'risk'.
                        <br> <br>
                        Should I have waited for the 16? -- Maybe but I would have still been paying the high prices for a really bad phone along with possibly not even being able to get an iPhone 16 when they release. But also simply the upgrades for the 16 probably isn't that much as the 15 will still get updates for years to come and Apple Inteligence will still work on the 15, if it doesn't I'm sure lots of people will be mad.
                        <br> <br>
                        So simply, I have a new phone, within the past 12 hours I've been enjoying it and I hope that over time it will keep on function as well as it is at the moment... Also i'm glad that I have such a nice camera now, It actually makes me want to start recording little vlog videos like I used to again. Who knows what the future will bring but I will stay possitive for the future of Technology as well as my own personal projects.
