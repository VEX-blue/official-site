                        I've spent the past month plus being a 'pillion' / passenger for someone on there motorbike, and I've got to say it far out beats getting the bus... So firstly what have I been doing on the back of a motorbike? I met someone online and we started to hang out, they have a SUZUKI GSX-R125 and was still on L-plates when we first met, after the first time meeting they done their A2 - Module 1 & 2 making them be able to go on the Motorway along with having a Pillion on the back, I made it very obvious that I wanted to go on a ride and see how it goes, and the next time they where over (a few days after passing) then we'd go out for a little ride together.
                        <br> <br>
                        <img class="article-img" src="https://cdn.masto.host/southamptonsocial/media_attachments/files/113/053/863/351/250/096/original/19304cc4407dbbc1.png">
                        <br>
                        Our ride took us to the city where we'd grab some McDonald's and relax before heading back. We quickly learnt that we needed Comms as we both really couldn't hear each-other and because it was my first time on a bike I was holding onto him really closely, luckily each time we stopped at a red light I got little tips of what not to do as I was very new to it all. I'm glad to say I now don't shift unless we are stopped as well as now am a lot more confident that I don't have to be grabbing hold of him for dear life, instead just a gentle holding of the hips is good enough.
                        <br> <br>
                        We've taken quite a few trips out since the first time going including ones to drop me off at my weekly group I go to where I get taken down, dropped off and then he goes back to mine for a bit before picking me back up and it's been amazing seeing the other bikers react to his cute cat eared helmet to the point I have now ordered my own. We've done a few trips to see my family as some have recently reached out and others I see regularly but we wanted to do a surprise trip. One of the trips was definitely a key trip to make, taking me to go get my first pair of Gloves and ended up paying for a Jacket as well. Overall I have spent close to £500 in total on gear with my Helmet given to me for free, and now owning my own Gloves, Jacket and Boots with just my trousers and a newer intercom needed in the future due to the one we did get being patchy and hard to understand along with not allowing music and the intercom to played at the same time.
                        <br> <br>
                        How am I feeling about it? -- Even though I don't enjoy relying on people, it feels amazing to be able to get to my location in less than an hour (without having to keep to the routes of buses as well as being able to catch up with family). It has made me not only really happy but it makes me want to learn to ride again, especially with how much I've spent on gear.
                        <br> <br>
                        What is my plans for the future? -- Well I've become a huge fan of motorbikes, even more so than a few years back when I just wanted to get get from A-to-B faster. With some experience on the bike including basic clutch control in a parking lot, it's really made me feel confident in myself that I could actually get on the road and ride myself places. After getting my trousers I'll be looking at doing my CBT, and finally getting my first bike. At the moment I'm looking at a Honda CB125R but might look at some other bikes closer to the time as the insurance on any bike for a new rider is pretty high.
