                    <p class="rem1-25 center">
                        Yesterday marked our one year anniversary of becoming a company (September 6th, 2023 being our company registration date) and I can tell you, we've made both lots of progress as well as so little in other areas, I took breaks from creating and pushing the company at times, along with getting confused and overwhelmed by how much there is to do.
                        <br> <br>
                        So first of all, why did I create VEX.blue? -- I originally created VEX.blue as an acronym as the website came before the company, I was originally going to call the company 'Video Editing Xavia', The Xavia taken from my last name and Video Editing, well it's our main service we try to provide to people. This obviously changed when I realised I could do VHS Conversions & Podcasting services that I was already helping provide for free to my grandad as well as Trans Pride Southampton; a organisation I helped Found.
                        <br> <br>
                        Obviously over the year we've added various more services such as;
                        <br>
                        - Southampton.Social our Mastodon instance for local users (completely free from Southampton, UK users to use by the way)
                        <br>
                        - Social Media Management for Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon for the moment but will probably expand into the META suite in the future.
                        <br>
                        and just recently our Articles, this is what you are reading right now. Each day I write a little article to explain something or give support by giving a small tutorial, and even just little 'META' updates like this one.
                        <br> <br>
                        There are many ways we could expand into the future, as of the moment I am learning more and more about web-development as seen by the new <a class="delinkify italics articlelink" href="\article/2024/09/02/welcome-to-v2.2">v2.2</a> of the website. Sadly I am still working on a static website but I may start looking into how to work with such intergrations as react in the future, stepping up my game and learning how to make dynamic pages making it easier for future updates and even change of styles or themes in the future.
                        <br> <br>
                        Will any new services drop before the end of the year? -- I have been looking into one service that could possibly drop in the near future and it's all to do with our Southampton.Social project, and that is hosting Mastodon Instances, we'd hope to help people easily run a Mastodon Instance for themselves. family and/or friends. These would most likely be cheap small instances but I'd give the added benefit of managing them by blocking Instances that are outright illegal as well as giving tech support if someone needed help. This does not have release-date as of the moment but now I've mentioned about it, I may actually start making the pages for it.
                        <br> <br>
                        What makes VEX.blue different than other companies? -- We try to make sure that every penny you spend on us is worth it, along with are currently a one person team when it comes to most of our services & projects. Our goals are simple, make it easier for people to be creative and provide one of the best services for the prices we set. Here's to another year, you can always support us in our socials at the bottom of each page.
